# Async Data Fetching Project


This project demonstrates how to fetch data asynchronously using JavaScript Promises and `async/await`.

## Overview

The project simulates fetching user profiles, posts, and comments with error handling using mock data. It includes:

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that includes buttons to fetch and clear data.
- **styles.css**: Contains basic styling for the page.
- **data.js**: Provides mock data and functions to simulate data fetching with potential errors.
- **main.js**: Implements asynchronous functions to fetch data and update the page content.
